MEDlunteer
======================

## Purpose
Medical volunteers interact with patients and can provide insight for health care profesionals on the state of their patients.  However, their feedback is often unheard or documented in a difficult to access medium.

MEDlunteer is a platform that records and manages volunteer interactions for easy access by health care professionals.
